# Risk Mitigation

## Technical Risks

- **FUSE Stability**: Extensive testing with different kernels and file managers
- **Memory Leaks**: Regular profiling and automated leak detection
- **Database Corruption**: Transaction safety and backup mechanisms
- **Feed Compatibility**: Test with wide variety of real-world feeds
- **Performance Degradation**: Continuous benchmarking and optimization

## Operational Risks

- **Configuration Errors**: Validation and helpful error messages
- **Network Failures**: Robust retry logic and offline mode
- **Resource Exhaustion**: Monitoring and automatic resource management
- **Security Issues**: Regular security audits and dependency updates
- **User Experience**: Usability testing with target file managers

## Mitigation Strategies

### FUSE-Related Risks
- **Mount Point Issues**: Automatic directory creation and cleanup
- **Stale Mounts**: Force unmount capabilities and proper cleanup
- **Permission Problems**: Clear error messages and suggestions
- **Resource Leaks**: Proper session management and cleanup

### Feed Processing Risks
- **Network Timeouts**: Configurable timeouts and retry logic
- **Malformed Feeds**: Graceful degradation and error reporting
- **Large Feeds**: Streaming processing and memory limits
- **Rate Limiting**: Respect server limits and implement backoff

### Data Integrity Risks
- **Cache Corruption**: Validation and automatic recovery
- **Configuration Loss**: Backup and versioning strategies
- **Feed Data Loss**: Persistence layer with transaction safety
- **Concurrent Access**: Proper locking and conflict resolution

### User Experience Risks
- **Complex Setup**: Automated initialization and clear documentation
- **Error Messages**: User-friendly explanations with actionable solutions
- **Performance Issues**: Monitoring and optimization alerts
- **Compatibility**: Testing with popular file managers and tools
